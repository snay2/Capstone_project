It’s complicated. Some 683 people have died below the rims (thus "in" Grand Canyon) during the known history of Grand Canyon after the early 1860s. Since the canyon became a national park in 1919, the number is 653 people -- but not all of them died in the park, because the canyon extends well beyond the park boundaries to the Navajo, Havasupai and Hualapai Indian reservations and Lake Mead Recreational Area. (We did not tally deaths on the rims unless they were air crashes or homicides.)

Obama: A fourth-straight year of trillion-dollar deficits is projected. Federal spending is estimated at 23.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, up from about 20 percent in previous administration, and is forecast to decline to 21.8 percent by 2016. Won approval to raise debt limit to avoid default. Calls for tackling the debt with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases.

Also, would set a 30 percent tax rate on taxpayers making more than $1 million, increasing taxes for some but not all millionaires and billionaires.

The museum has been a source of pride ever since its improbable beginning in 1982, after civic leaders convinced Cleveland collectors Reynolds and Eleanor Morse to trust their collection to a small city they had never heard of. St. Petersburg seemed the location of last resort. Every major museum they approached rebuffed the Morses, saying they would welcome a few choice works by the Spanish surrealist but not the entire collection the couple had spent 40 years amassing. The Morses' gamble paid off. The museum has been self-sufficient and profitable since 1984 from admissions and shop sales, never needing significant fundraising. Until now.

The theory, which comes courtesy of University of Missouri political science professor Marvin Overby, goes like this: Santorum's "insurgent" campaign against the better-organized Mitt Romney needs emotional victories to sustain momentum in lieu of a well-organized ground campaign. But after Saturday's primary, the caucus schedule enters a bit of a lull. “The process slows down," Overby said in a telephone interview on Thursday. "There are going to be very few events someone like a Santorum or Gingrich, an insurgent candidate, needs to feed off of.”

Memphis brings two guys off the bench that definitely could be in the starting lineup on playoff-caliber teams. Forward Zach Randolph (11.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg) missed two months during the middle of the season because of a knee injury, and he's been slowly returning to form. If Randolph gets in his groove, he's an absolute force. O.J. Mayo (12.6 ppg, 4.3 rpg) is a streaky shooter who can also defend on the perimeter. Gilbert Arenas has played well since joining the team, and Dante Cunningham and Hamed Haddadi add size and toughness.

Cornish pasties will be filled with potatoes, beef, onion and rutabaga in a flaky crust. Miners in the copper fields of northern England would hold the sturdy dough, then toss it aside, supposedly for the ghosts (knockers) there, but also avoiding invasive arsenic there. She will serve them warm with gravy. Early birds can plan on breakfast items under Muscroft's skilful touch. In deference to English royalty, she will offer chocolate cookie (biscuit) cake, Prince William's choice for the groom's cake at his wedding.
The nation's housing market has been battered in recent years by low home prices and vast numbers of foreclosures, and politicians from both parties want to find a way to have private lenders -- not the government -- bear more of the burden.

Baylor parlayed a disappointing regular season — a 12-6 conference regular season that included sweeps by Missouri and Kansas — into a title-game tournament run in Kansas City. Perhaps the sting of this loss will inspire Baylor next week.

Deitch said he helped plan the festival for its sponsor, Mercedes-Benz, including recruiting Mike D as the curator who will oversee its offerings of art, music and food. Admission is free. With Mercedes covering the cost and making a contribution to the museum, Deitch expects it to generate several hundred thousand dollars for MOCA's more conventional activities, while continuing his populist push.

Matheny lifted Lohse after he had thrown seven shutout innings against the Cincinnati Reds on April 17. An unearned run against the bullpen cost him a win in that game, which the Cardinals eventually won 2-1.
Update: Chivas USA and embattled Coach Robin Fraser head into their fifth home match of the season still looking for their first score at the Home Depot Center. And this time Chivas will be challenged by a short-handed Chicago team that has lost defender Jalil Anibaba and Coach Frank Klopas to one-game suspensions for a post-match scuffle following last week's 2-1 loss to Seattle. Chicago hasn't lost since June 2008 to Chivas, which allowed a season-high four goals in its loss at Colorado a week ago. Chivas striker Juan Pablo Angel has traditionally fared well against Chicago, with six goals in 13 games. And midfielder Nick LaBrocca has scored in his last two matches against the Fire.

As part of the new basic agreement, an International Talent Committee was formed in December. Manfred and Michael Weiner, director of the MLB players association, are co-directors. The worldwide draft will be its main focus, but they will address a number of issues in their twice-monthly meetings.
The speakers are identified with their names and a tag. They are never authors or playwrights, but always "best-selling authors" and "prize-winning playwrights," even when you've never heard of them. The level of hype makes even a Hollywood agent sound sincere.
Apparently not, because later Andrea sneaks back in the house, reminds him of the loading dock incident and Don pushes himself on her wildly. Is it bad I kind of liked seeing Don get back into manwhore mode?

Remove the ice cream from the freezer and let it melt slowly at room temperature, which will take about 1 hour. Try to time it so that the ice cream has just barely melted but is still thick and cold when you are ready to serve dessert; if necessary, stir it to speed the melting, but don't let it come to room temperature or it will become thin.
In a sense, such programs don't change opinions on a given social issue so much as reflect the ways in which American opinions have already changed. In the 1970s, the time was ripe for a character like Archie Bunker. America was ready to acknowledge and laugh at the ignorance that lived on in his resentful heart. Such a character wouldn't have been possible a generation earlier, when the struggle for civil rights was still very much a matter of life and death.
"Accordingly, it is difficult to conceive that Petitioner is unable to meet his expenses and pay for his attorney fees."
If the Rams truly are confident that Smith can return and stay healthy, that would lessen the need to expend a high pick - such as their No. 2 overall selection - on someone such as Southern California's Matt Kalil. Then again, counting on Smith and Rodger Saffold, who missed the last four games of 2011 because of a pectoral muscle injury, would be operating without a safety net.

The Jets took their only lead with 1:20 remaining in the first half, after a 2-yard touchdown run by Sanchez gave his team a 9-6 advantage. But before that play, Sanchez made a mistake that proved quite costly: He heard the coaches on the headset talking about a time out, but he called it too soon, with double-digits left on the play clock.

On the day the Bears played the Packers for a trip to the Super Bowl, only 22 players on their 53-man roster and two-man injured-reserve list came to the team as rookies from 2005 through 2010, be it as draft picks or college free agents. Packers general manager Ted Thompson, who was hired in 2005, boasted 16 more players of that ilk - 38 - counting an injured list that swelled to 15 strong.

A portion of his faith rests in the team's imminent return to health. Towers spent part of his Thursday watching two of his rehabbing players participate in games at Salt River Fields. He said center fielder Chris Young "crushed" three balls and that shortstop Stephen Drew also looked good swinging the bat.
I like where NetZero is going with this idea. High-speed USB sticks and portable hot spots have been around for years, eliminating the need to hunt for good Wi-Fi or to stay in one place with a fast connection. But their monthly fees—on top of monthly phone bills and home Internet bills—made them a luxury item.
It remained a one-possession game for the rest of the second quarter with Oklahoma City holding a pair of three-point leads and Dallas going on top by two before Durant's late jumper made it a 47-47 game at the break.

A You're right -- that's some travel nightmare! Bahamasair should have gotten your tickets right with US Airways, and when it couldn't, the airline or your travel agent should have fixed it for you.
How naive, how arrogant. As we now know, that moronic war of choice raged on for years afterward, increasing in intensity and taking thousands of American lives and perhaps hundreds of thousands of mostly innocent Iraqi lives. We all know that Saddam was a bad guy, but we also know that he was an insignificant threat to the United States, WMD claims notwithstanding.
Yet Hunter also cautioned that it was "early days," with nationalized mortgage lender Northern Rock and part-taxpayer owned RBS and Lloyds expected to report gloomier figures because of their greater exposure to retail markets.

Into this world step two strangers, Goldberg (Tony Papenfuss) and McCann (Martin Ruben). Papenfuss's Goldberg borrows a page from Joe Pesci, gliding about like a bellicose slug, a trail of slime in his wake. He jabs at Stanley, coddles Meg and abuses a local girl, Lulu (Katie Guentzel). Ruben is less certain, though his physical bulk makes McCann a worthy thug.

Because of filing deadlines, the bill would have to pass by early April to force a referendum this year. Redfern said opponents also could try to pass a constitutional amendment aimed at protecting collective bargaining, which lawmakers could not alter and could be brought at any time, on the 2012 ballot.
Unsure where the class met and expecting an hour of traditional track work like wind-sprints and quarter-mile repeats, I headed straight for the second-floor track and began jogging. Everyone else, meanwhile, was next door in the studio, stretching, jumping, and squatting to break a sweat and get the heart pumping. It took me five minutes to realize my mistake.

I know there are a lot of Brad Pitt haters out there. I'm not one of them. I think he's been on a heck of a roll with a string of commanding performances, from the crazed Nazi-scalper in "Inglourious Basterds" to the stern father in "The Tree of Life." He has an ease and maturity as Beane, mixed with a chronic fear of failure. It's a splendid and rich performance.

Mike Mendiburu, president of High Point Solutions, knows his Sparta-based technology firm was largely unknown until news broke Tuesday that Rutgers football fans would be sitting in High Point Solutions Stadium for the next 10 years.
The economy is a huge anchor on Garland's efforts. Ohio has 10.3 percent unemployment and the central part of the state seems to be struggling especially hard. While modest job growth is expected elsewhere in the state, a recent survey of area employers found that more companies plan to trim payrolls than add workers.
Consumer advocates see it another way. "It's a nice way of saying, 'We want you out and we want to entice you financially to get out,'" says Mr. Arnold of CardRatings.com. "It's not about them handing out $300 out of the kindness of their hearts."

Spring Creek Productions ("Analyze This," "Blood Diamond") bought the film rights in perpetuity for $500,000, plus an additional $1 million if it goes into production. Not bad for a story that had struggled to break through as a screenplay and hadn't yet found a publisher in book form. Of course, once the sale of the film rights went public, the novel was quickly picked up and published by Avon Books.
Ralph Fucci, a 30-year commuter who has parked at NJ Transit’s Princeton Junction lot in West Windsor for 17 years and pays $195 quarterly, frets that a private operator will want to recoup its tens of millions of dollars of investment by raising parking fees.

Rovero-Herrera's back at it, though, chasing donations to cover the trip.
The re-signing of cornerback Tim Jennings before the start of free agency reduced the need to sign a free agent from another team. But the Bears still are likely to either draft a cornerback or sign a free agent who isn't in high demand.

In the real world, there is a vast variety of overlapping jurisdictions with different data formats and legal standards for reporting. Some records are public documents, but many are not available to journalists or other members of the public for a variety of reasons.

Some will undoubtedly never leave the filing cabinet.

Santorums record in Congress has come under fire as he has surged in the race.

Master of carnage Jason Statham plays Luke Wright, a deadly mixed-martial arts fighter who's inexplicably working as a punching bag in the arena until he runs afoul of Russian mobsters. Then he has a chance encounter with a 12-year-old math prodigy who has been kidnapped by Chinese gangsters and sets out to become her protector. Writer-director Boaz Yakin proves the ideal enabler for Statham's brand of mindless violence. Together, they turn Manhattan into little more than a shooting gallery, stacking up corpses in service of a supposed story about one man's path to redemption. Rated R; strong violence, language. 1 hour, 35 minutes. By David Germain, Associated Press.

As I went through the first year playing, the second half of the semester, I had to sit out because I was academically ineligible. I really had to turn it around and focus. No more playing. Nobody is going to give you a free pass. I finished the semester with two As and in summer school I got two more As.”

Season recap: Unranked to start the season, Palo Verde proved to be one of the best teams in Division III. It earned the top seed in the state tournament and reached the state championship match, losing in overtime. The team did this with just 13 players on the roster. It played even better than it did last season when the team featured one of the better players in the state in midfielder LeeAndra Smith, now playing at the University of Arizona. Palo Verde reached the semifinals of the big Brandon Bean tournament to begin the season, upsetting Tucson Catalina Foothills (the eventual 2012 Division II champions) in the quarterfinal round. Palo Verde also played without one of the team's better players -- midfielder Alexis Torres -- due to a season-ending injury. Senior Jasmine Stokes scored a state-high 51 goals.

I talked with Ken Burns (documentarian who made the PBS film "Baseball") about this. Baseball doesn't volunteer for this. But there are many themes that are undercurrents in the rest of the country that baseball brings to the stage.
Like any other employment sector, the government sector should expand or contract as needs and willingness to pay change among consumers (in this case, taxpayers). Our federal government, especially, has not been willing to contract. Instead, it has borrowed in order to keep expanding. The consequences of that have been delayed repeatedly, in hopes that the economy would recover sufficiently to let a government in hock up to its eyeballs keep living the lie that all is well.

It's hard to walk far without encountering a movie crew on location. The other day in downtown L.A., there were no fewer than three of them. At Second and Los Angeles streets, a film crew had taken over a parking lot and filled it with cameras, cranes, lights, wires and trailers. A small crowd, held at bay by a security guard, was watching. It looked like the real thing.

I am often asked about tipping. You will want to do some research on the countries you will be visiting because they are not all the same. Most Western European countries do not require a tip because it is already built into the meal's cost. But even in those countries it is common practice if you were satisfied with the meal and service to leave a little something extra, although it is not expected. Most people will round up to the nearest euro and leave that as a tip.

Ben Grossman, natural resources supervisor for St. Charles County's Department of Parks and Recreation, said: "With the lack of rainfall, sometimes the trees drop their leaves because they're no longer producing food.

Here's one possibility: Because it might actually be in the economic interests of the taxpayers. Those who believe government can do no right, that every dollar spent by Annapolis is wasted, will never, ever entertain that thought, of course, but there are good arguments for both these possible tax increases that deserve consideration.
To protect him from rival chiefs, the young "Pai'ea" was quickly hidden in Waipi'o, the remote Valley of the Kings. Today the six-mile-long, privately owned valley can be toured by horseback, mule-drawn wagon and passenger van (808-775-7121) — or you can hike the very steep road down to the black-sand beach (protect yourself by using bug spray, and not going swimming.) Although the valley was then home to thousands of Native Hawaiians, it's thought that his time here earned the young royal the name Kamehameha, "the lonely one."

"That indicates they have evidence (Zimmerman) was chasing Trayvon because he was black," said Florida defense attorney Richard Hornsby. "It's difficult to think how one prosecutor didn't charge him at all and another thought there was enough evidence to justify a second-degree charge. It's a pretty drastic swing."
Rosenbaum bases much of his thesis on Christie’s widely distributed and widely debated comments at a Jan. 8 rally for Mitt Romney in New Hampshire. That’s the one where a spectator shouted something at Christie about job numbers going down, and Christie replied with the now-infamous: “Something’s going to go down tonight, but it ain’t going to be jobs, sweetheart.”
Clinton says the state's ban against same-sex marriage is safe without the amendment, but said passage will affect the state's ability to attract new businesses and could diminish laws protecting women from domestic violence.
Though the remainder of the November schedule is already in jeopardy, Stern said he had no plans to cancel any more games at this moment.

Eventually, as the Nazis marched across Europe, Carrington suffered a nervous breakdown and wound up in a psychiatric ward in Madrid.

The new and higher fees come as a regulation that took effect this month cut the average fees that merchants pay for debit transactions to about 24 cents from 44 cents. In addition, federal rules that have reined in overdraft fees have cost banks billions of dollars, which they are trying to make up in more-direct consumer charges.

* With Lance Berkman mending, it will be interesting to see if teams start looking for other ways to go after Matt Carpenter. He's off to a great start, and usually pitchers will take note of that and adjust. It's a little early to pinpoint trends, but the data shows Carpenter has done very well when pitchers try to go inside on him. Pitchers are pumping a lot of fastballs at Carpenter, and he's fighting them off. But Carpenter has done a lot of damage on mistake pitches, changeups and sliders. He's batting .500 against both of those pitches in the early stages.

As good as most of the sampler was, the entrees were an upgrade. Bubba's patented boneless pork sparerib steak was a wonder of moist, tender, smoky goodness. Batter-crusted sweet potato fries were crunchy outside, fluffy and sweet inside. A juicy, whole smoked chicken looked like more than enough to satisfy any 300-pound lineman. Our dining companion's St. Louis ribs also scored a touchdown with their moist, meaty goodness. Try to get there early on the weekend. But if you can't, Bubba's is worth the wait. -- Bob Migra, Special to The Plain Dealer
George Orwell said the quickest way to end a war is to lose it. But Obama's half-hearted embrace of a half-baked nonstrategy -- briefly feinting toward the Taliban (or al-Qaida, or a "syndicate of terror") while lunging for the exit ramp -- makes a protracted loss probable.

The takeover raised questions from competitors and the federal government, which questioned whether the combination of the nation's second- and fourth-largest cellphone carriers would violate antitrust laws.
Belger has been super-good to me, he said.
"We've been exploring all kinds of options for our public facility needs," San Soucie said, acknowledging that he knew of the two contracts. "There was certainly a study to look at how perhaps city hall, and police and court functions could fit into the Round."
The engagement argument comes down to this: Sanctions against Burma haven't worked. Two decades since the regime threw out the results of an election that it had (in its delusions of popularity) allowed, it is no more popular but no less entrenched. With U.S. companies and diplomats mostly absent, China has become the dominant power. The Burmese people remain poor and isolated from the world.
Finally, there are shows like AMC's "Mad Men" that we can't stream during the season. We could download them from iTunes, but the season costs about $35. So we'll wait for them to appear on Netflix at some point. Same for shows from HBO, which we usually have to wait a year to get on DVD.

Americans for Tax Reform donated $300,000 to a 1999 campaign to oppose the lottery in Alabama. The Mississippi tribal casino operator opposed the Alabama lottery because it worried about competition.
While Gunther Schuller's tag, Third Stream — classical and jazz tributaries merging to form another river — placed a label on classical-jazz fusions in 1957, examples of classical musicians raiding African influences exist even before jazz came to be. One can trace them as far back as Louis Moreau Gottschalk's piano music before the Civil War, then forward to Charles Ives' irreverent injections of disruptive ragtime in " Central Park in the Dark," Debussy's "Golliwog's Cakewalk" and Stravinsky's "L'Histoire du Soldat." Between the world wars, incorporating jazz into concert works became an international vogue — affecting domestic and European composers as diverse as Copland, Ravel, Kurt Weill, Erwin Schulhoff and even Shostakovich.
An annexation and transfer occurs when part of a district is annexed to a district and the balance of the annexed district's territory is transferred to one or more other districts.

"I just be honest," Jenkins said about talking about his past transgressions. "I don't have nothing to hide. That was my past, that was a year ago. I took my second route to go to UNA for a reason, to show people I wasn't a bad kid and I wasn't running from my problems."

Lunch at Wazuzu wasn't necessary, but in Vegas what is? With gluttony on the brain, I began with a vegan crunch roll ($18) — string beans, cucumber and avocado topped with Japanese rice crackers — and a California roll ($12) made with avocado, cucumber, asparagus and brown rice wrapped in seaweed. After mixing wasabi and ginger, I downed the four-piece crunch roll in seconds and felt that, finally, I was experiencing a side of Vegas previously unknown to my taste buds. Typical casino lunches used to consist of my sneaking French fries off friends' buffet plates. This, however, was no typical casino lunch.
Some of that material proves propulsive in helpful ways. The theme from the scherzo of Beethoven's Op. 131 quartet, for example, with its headlong drive toward five stuttering repeated notes, serves as a recurrent rhythmic motor, and Adams works some interesting variations on music from the Op. 135 quartet.
Whoever wins that primary in the heavily Democratic district along Lake Erie will face Libertarian Sean Stipe and the winner of a GOP battle between auctioneer Steven Kraus and Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, who became known as "Joe the Plumber" after a televised exchange on tax policy with President Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential race.

Waldhauser appointed a three-star general, Steven Hummer, to lead the internal Marine Corps investigation. The probe will look into the question of what prompted the four Marines' behavior, said one officer, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss an internal matter.

But Whitman was something of a wild-haired, and wild-mannered, king to those who knew him. The land he ruled, with its constant flow of lodgers and poets from all over the world, might as well have come out of the books he loved, and read so voraciously. (One per night.)

Considering the grim condition my bracket is in, there's really no reason for me to be consistent, but that's what I'm going to do. I'll go with form in today's game, North Carolina over Ohio, Kansas over North Carolina State. Seems simple enough. Had it not been for the injury to UNC's Kendall Marshall, I'd have called an audible and gone with the Tar Heels. But with his status in doubt, I'll go with Thomas Robinson and Kansas. Sure they're young and they barely beat Purdue, but teams that reach the Final Four seem to have one close call along the way. And they can't possibly shoot as poorly as they did in the Purdue game. Rooted on by their fans, who should be the dominant presences in the building, I'm picking the Jayhawks. Carolina fans, you can thank me later.
I spent some time the other day looking through my "Civil Religion" posts from the past (almost) three years. Strangely enough, I never once wrote generally about what I'm interested in and why I write about it. In hindsight, I think that's good. This blog has simply become what it is by becoming what it is. It has been fun to just let it happen and to now see where the trail went from here.
The avocado and sprouts topping the Louie burger ($7.50) seemed a bit frou-frou in contrast to the old Dooley's, but a rasher of bacon between the veggies and patty gave it a stouter composition.
Edwards made nine starts as a rookie for the Bills, then started all 14 games he played in 2008, completing 65.5 percent of his passes and compiling an 85.4 passer rating, despite 10 interceptions to go with his 11 touchdown passes.

The appeal of Messrs. Kammenos and Kouvelis to many Greeks is similar. Both say they want Greece to stay in the euro—as more than 70% of voters here do. But both men lambaste the political establishment that has ruled, and often misruled, Greece since the nation's military junta fell in 1974. And both men say Greece's austerity deal with the EU and the International Monetary Fund must be renegotiated to secure gentler terms for Greeks.

Should I expose them to an idea that would have seemed unthinkable to me even as an adult on September 10, 2001? That some people have so much hatred in them they'd drive jet planes full of fuel into buildings full of people?
What's cool about it: "Smile" isn't just a "lost" album, it's a kind of existential one. No one (not even its creators) can tell you exactly what its official version should consist of. That's because genius/lunatic Brian Wilson never settled on the final selection of its tracks, some of which ended up on subsequent albums, and all of which have been out on scratchy bootleg versions for years. This set, made for true B.B. maniacs, will further complicate its strange history - which, naturally, will only add to its myth.
TR: It's a lot of just day-by-day. I take notes every day and write down things that I've been learning and working on throughout the day and things that I want to continue to reflect on.

On the other hand, I had a client in Canada who proudly talked about having doughnut shops seemingly on every corner there. Based on my experiences in his country, that wasn't far from the truth. The Tim Horton's chain of Canadian doughnut emporiums has over 3,000 locations of its own. And they're quite yummy, eh? So in my mind, Heaven looks more like Toronto than Paris.

Mix just until the batter is smooth. Stir in the coconut. Evenly spread the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. Bake at 350°F until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Cut into ¾-inch slices (you won't need all of the cake).

 Floors: The Swiffer-type mop works great on tile or linoleum, but it requires expensive refill pads that don't necessarily outperform generic refills costing up to 60 percent less. For the extra frugal, the mop sheets can be flipped over and used again. Or wash them in a mesh laundry bag for multiple uses. A super-cheap alternative: A simple string mop or sponge mop paired with homemade floor cleaner (1/4 cup white vinegar mixed with one quart of warm water).
My view changed when my wife, Dorothy, and I moved to Los Angeles in 1983. She and her mother had been born here, although when Dorothy was 9 they moved to her father's Kentucky hometown because the real estate fortune he had hoped to make in L.A. had never materialized. So there was a personal history in Southern California, if not the kind of history with a capital "H" I was used to from Philadelphia. We settled in Los Feliz because we wanted a house that looked like those we had seen in movies, particularly film noirs like "Double Indemnity": a Spanish Colonial with citrus trees and a pool in the backyard.

For example, Groupon reported $1.52 billion in revenue for the first half of 2011. But after the SEC questioned it, Groupon in late September submitted new documents that showed that net revenue in the first half of this year was $688 million.

Even without the presence of U.S. troops, America's footprint in Iraq is immense. In addition to the fortress near the site of Saddam Hussein's palace, two additional, $100 million buildings are slated to be built outside Baghdad as mini-embassies in the north and south of Iraq. Iraqis know that U.S. troops acting as trainers will still be in Iraq, both as a permanent presence of less than 200 and as an undetermined presence of U.S. troops permanently stationed in neighboring countries. In addition to these troops and embassy personnel, a large and robust force of CIA agents are presumed to be on the ground. As one of the largest contingencies of foreign personnel in any sovereign nation, it is no surprise that Iraqis refused to bargain away their right to enforce their own laws by giving our troops immunity from prosecution.
